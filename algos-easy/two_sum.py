# Two Sum

# Write a function, two_sum, that takes in a list and a target sum as arguments. 
# The function should return a tuple containing a two of indices whose elements sum to the given target. 
# The indices returned must be unique.
# Be sure to return the indices, not the elements themselves.
# There is guaranteed to be one such two that sums to the target.


def two_sum(numbers, target_sum):

# TEST CASES

# two_sum([4, 7, 9, 2, 5, 1], 3) # -> (3, 5)
# two_sum([1, 6, 7, 2], 13) # -> (1, 2)
# two_sum([9, 9], 18) # -> (0, 1)
# two_sum([6, 4, 2, 8 ], 12) # -> (1, 3)
